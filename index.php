			            <p>
			            We cater all aspects of auto repairs and preventive maintenance services for major brands and types of vehicles at reasonable costs. We also sell different car parts at our retail store. That is why we are now fast becoming the number one choice and are preferred by motorists over their car dealers.

			            <br>
			            Aside from that, we also sell our products online through Lazada, an ecommerce site. With additional freight charge, Fronte Motor Parts, Inc. can ship items nationwide, subject to terms and condition.
